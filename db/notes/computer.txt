What is Computer Programming?
Definition: Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms.

Basic Concepts of Programming
Variables and Data Types

Variables: Storage locations with a name that hold data which can be modified during program execution.
Example: int age = 25;
Data Types: Specifies the type of data a variable can hold.
Common data types:
Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., int)
Float/Double: Decimal numbers (e.g., float, double)
Character: Single characters (e.g., char)
String: Sequence of characters (e.g., string)
Boolean: True or false values (e.g., bool)
Operators

Arithmetic Operators: Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %).
Example: int sum = 5 + 3;
Relational Operators: Compare two values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
Example: bool isEqual = (5 == 3);
Logical Operators: Combine multiple conditions (&&, ||, !).
Example: bool result = (5 > 3) && (3 < 4);
Control Structures

Conditional Statements: Execute different code blocks based on conditions.

if-else: Executes code if a condition is true, otherwise executes different code.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
if (age >= 18) {
    cout << "Adult";
} else {
    cout << "Minor";
}
switch: Selects one of many code blocks to execute.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        cout << "Excellent";
        break;
    case 'B':
        cout << "Good";
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Unknown grade";
}
Loops: Repeat a block of code multiple times.

for: Executes a block of code a specific number of times.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
while: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
do-while: Executes a block of code once, then repeats as long as a condition is true.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
int i = 0;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
Functions

Definition: A block of code that performs a specific task, designed to be reusable.
Example:
