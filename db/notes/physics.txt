Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

Statement: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
Examples:
A book on a table remains stationary until someone moves it.
A moving car will continue to move in a straight line unless it hits an obstacle or the driver applies brakes.
Concept of inertia: The resistance of an object to change its state of motion.
Newton's Second Law of Motion (Law of Acceleration)

Statement: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, F = ma (Force = mass × acceleration).
Examples:
Pushing a lighter object requires less force compared to a heavier object to achieve the same acceleration.
A car accelerates faster when more force is applied to the gas pedal.
Importance: Understanding how different forces affect the motion of objects.
Newton's Third Law of Motion (Action and Reaction)

Statement: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Examples:
When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with equal force.
The recoil of a gun when it is fired.
Application: Explaining various phenomena like walking, swimming, and the functioning of rockets.

Force and Types of Forces

Definition: A push or pull on an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object.
Types:
Gravitational force: The force of attraction between two masses.
Frictional force: The force that opposes the motion of an object.
Tension force: The force transmitted through a string or rope when it is pulled tight by forces acting from opposite ends.
Normal force: The support force exerted upon an object in contact with another stable object.
Friction

Definition: The force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact.
Types:
Static friction: The frictional force that prevents two surfaces from sliding past each other.
Kinetic friction: The frictional force acting between moving surfaces.
Factors affecting friction:
Surface texture: Rougher surfaces have higher friction.
Normal force: Greater normal force increases friction.
Gravity

Definition: A force that attracts any two objects with mass.
