Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. The process involves the transformation of light energy into chemical energy, stored in the bonds of glucose molecules.

Key Points:
- Takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
- Requires sunlight, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2).
- Produces glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) as by-products.
- The chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
  6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2

The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and glands that processes food. Its primary function is to convert food into essential nutrients that the body needs to function properly and to eliminate waste products.

Key Points:
- The main parts of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.
- Digestion starts in the mouth with the mechanical breakdown of food by chewing and the chemical breakdown by saliva.
- The stomach further breaks down food using acids and enzymes.
- The small intestine is where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs.
- The large intestine absorbs water and forms waste products into stool.
