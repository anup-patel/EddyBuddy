The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.

Key Points:
- The main processes of the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.
- Evaporation: Water from oceans, rivers, lakes, and other sources heats up and turns into vapor, rising into the atmosphere.
- Condensation: Water vapor cools down in the atmosphere and forms clouds.
- Precipitation: Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
- Collection: Water collects in oceans, rivers, lakes, and soil, continuing the cycle.

Landforms are natural features of the Earth's surface. They are created by various geological processes and can vary greatly in size and shape.

Key Points:
- Mountains: Large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, usually with steep sides and significant height.
- Valleys: Low areas between mountains or hills, often with a river running through them.
- Plateaus: Flat, elevated landforms that rise sharply above the surrounding area on at least one side.
- Plains: Large, flat, or gently rolling areas, typically found at low elevations.
- Deserts: Arid regions with very little rainfall and sparse vegetation.
- Coastal Areas: Regions where the land meets the ocean, characterized by beaches, cliffs, and dunes.
